## 🚀 About The Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Instead of a boring static page, I decided to recreate the legendary **Windows XP** experience using standard web technologies.  
This project demonstrates my skills in **DOM manipulation, Event Handling, and CSS Styling** without relying on heavy frameworks.

## ✨ Features

Here is what you can do in this OS:

- **🖥️ Desktop Environment:** Moveable icons, selection box, and active desktop background.
- **🪟 Window System:** Drag, Resize, Minimize, Maximize, and Close windows just like the real OS.
- **📂 File System:** Navigate through simulated drives (C:) and folders inside `My Computer`.
- **🎨 Paint App:** A working canvas to draw your pixel art!
- **🎵 Winamp Player:** Listen to music with a retro interface.
- **🧮 Calculator:** A fully functional standard calculator.
- **📝 Notepad:** Write notes that persist even after refreshing the page (LocalStorage).
- **🖱️ Context Menu:** Custom right-click menu with "Properties" to change Wallpapers/Themes.
- **🔒 Login Screen:** Realistic boot sequence and user login.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Structuring the OS layout.
- **CSS3:** Advanced styling, gradients, and animations to mimic the XP Luna theme.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The core logic for the Window Manager, Taskbar, and Apps.
- **No Frameworks:** Pure, lightweight code.
